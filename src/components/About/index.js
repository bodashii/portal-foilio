                My name is Nicolas Young. I enjoy a lot of hobbies, but find
                the persistent need to improve my skills to be a bigger joy.
                Programming, Coding, Puzzles, Games, anything that could 
                stun my brain and really make it think critically was 
                addictive. After playing with some drafting programs when I
                was 10 my father introduced me to programming books. C++ and 
                visual basic. I later went on in high school and took part in
                the computer science and video game design classes. Now after
                a long hiatus I hope to bridge gaps and make the tech I 
                interact with a joy to use.
