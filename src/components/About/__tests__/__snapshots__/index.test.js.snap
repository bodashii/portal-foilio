        My name is Nicolas Young. I enjoy a lot of hobbies, but find the persistent need to improve my skills to be a bigger joy. Programming, Coding, Puzzles, Games, anything that could stun my brain and really make it think critically was addictive. After playing with some drafting programs when I was 10 my father introduced me to programming books. C++ and visual basic. I later went on in high school and took part in the computer science and video game design classes. Now after a long hiatus I hope to bridge gaps and make the tech I interact with a joy to use.
